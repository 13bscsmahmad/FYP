Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA)
==============================================

PCA
---

"PCA is a classical statistical method for transforming attributes of a dataset into a new set of uncorrelated attributes called principal components (PCs). PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, while still retaining as much of the variability of the dataset as possible. High dimensional data can pose problems for machine learning as predictive models based on such data run the risk of overfitting." - source: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.74.8032&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Instructions
------------

1) Modify script1.py variables, then run it.
2) Modify script2.py variables (some of which depend on script1.py), then run it.
3) Modify ipca.py accordingly, then run it. The output file contains a new set of features determined by PCA done on the original data. The final data is in LIBSVM format.
